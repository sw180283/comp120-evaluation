\abstract{In this reflective report, I'll be reviewing my learning while reflecting on my projects and approaches for the first semester.}

\section{Introduction}

The three weakness I explore in this report are: time management, critical evaluation and communication. All of these skills are significant to me for professional practise and have been emphasised during my first semester.

\section{Time Management}

\subsection{Description - What happened? What is being examined?}

One of my weaknesses was time management. With most tasks, it is crucial to follow a strict and thoughtful plan which accounts for all aspects of the project. For me, the relevance of this issue was for not anticipating all aspects of each project.

\subsection{How has this impacted my learning and projects?}

I found that my allocated work time had been misplaced. This not only lead to a low quality of work but also low quantity.

\subsection{Interpretation - What is relevant about this idea?}

Initially, I noticed that I did not feel confident in my abilities. At the time, I did not know how to overcome this issue which lead to frustration.

\subsection{Outcome- What have I learned and what can be done in the future?}

I now realise my time should have been more focused. For the future, I aim to make structured session objectives and expected completion times. If objectives are incomplete, then I must approach my lecturer or colleagues with my concerns. Next month, I shall examine my expectations of each week and whether my objectives were completed or guidance was sought. This focus would greatly contribute to my future career as a game developer.

\section{Critical Evaluation}

\subsection{Description - What happened? What is being examined?}

Another of my weaknesses was critical evaluation. The ability to critique my own work allows for issues to be discussed and improvements to be made.

\subsection{How has this impacted my learning and projects?}

Unlike my previous education, these tasks required my own objective evaluation of work quality. This lead to being overly critical of my work, in a way that wasn't constructive.

\subsection{Interpretation - What is relevant about this idea?}

For me, the issue arose from low confidence. Subsequently, I felt inappropriately equipped to offer critical advice. In addition to this, I felt unfamiliar with marking others work with regards to coding practise.

\subsection{Outcome- What have I learned and what can be done in the future?}

I now realise that making reference to project objectives focuses evaluation. In addition, using objectives as a checklist proves each topic has been discussed. For me, in a career as a game developer, this skill would provide focused group and individual reflection. Next month, I shall examine my peer reviews as to whether I covered, and suggested improvements, for all points in my checklist.

\section{Communication}

\subsection{Description - What happened? What is being examined?}

A final weakness is communication, which is relevant for all projects. In addition to verbal presentations, clearly written documents and code comments are crucial for project work flow. In group work, I failed to engage in discussion which lead to poorly assembled presentations.

\subsection{How has this impacted my learning and projects?}

Documentation and clear comments would have greatly improved my learning practise. It also would have increased my confidence and knowledge of my own work.

\subsection{Interpretation - What is relevant about this idea?}

For me, this aspect is crucial for future employment. A portfolio with code comprehension, through appropriate commenting, would improve my employability as a programmer.

\subsection{Outcome- What have I learned and what can be done in the future?}

After using Github, I feel confident using short description to identify issues or variables. Next month, I shall examine my Github submissions to ensure I followed appropriate naming conventions while adding comments during programming sessions.

\section{Communication}

For future learning, and professional practise, I aim to use SMART actions to ensure measureable and achievable standards of work.
