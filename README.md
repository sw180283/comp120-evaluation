# Comp110 Worksheets
Here are the following weekly report on my production and development of my worksheets.

##Introduction

The context of these reports are concerning the tinkering graphics and audio projects set during the first semester.

##Week 1 - Worksheet 1 _SpaceChem_
During the introduction of each section, I learned new ways to reduce the number of symbols, or functions, required to complete each circuit. While following and attempting to test out different approaches to different required molecule shapes or reformation, I began to adapt faster solutions with fewer symbols used.

This can be demonstrated by achieving the High Performance for "Every Day Is The First Day" which met the criteria of creating a circuit with fewer than 300 cycles. These skills for reducing the number of functions required to tackle a problem and find a solution are going to be useful when constructing code.

##Week 2 - Strings
Within COMP120 we began to experiment with the introduction of string text, which creates a word saved into the JES programme that is assigned to a particular value. For example if x = "apple", then the resulting _print_ function would look give this: 
```
print x  
apple
```
When combining this string format, it is possible to create more interesting uses when considering manipulation. When using a similar approach to maths in JES, the same can be done for combining strings. If x = "apple" and y = "fruit" then the resulting addition would print as:
```
print x+y  
applefruit.
```
This is an example of how I have started to learn the basics about JES and how it can be used and improved.

##Week 3 - Games Platform History Essay

//group presentations / researching task
//the same topic was covering the the same group
//have a set plan and updating work to show group project

The focus of this week was the start of our first essay, with group presentations that included work that our team had assembled together with individual focus on one console of the specified generation. It was a chance at our first group project and allowed different findings to group together which would help our research into our essay.

After being given research information about how to collect and reference our sources, I have been given the task of researching into the SG-1000.

After our presentation, I would have improved it with better group communication as there were some topics covered twice during individual research. Also, the length of our presentation could have been simplified which would have meant that there'd be no reading from the screen.

##Week 4 - Image Manipulation

//turtles
//struggled with class
//immediately questioned lecturer after class and remained in class until code functional

Additional uses for JES have been demonstrated, such as the use of turtles to generate images and also image maniupulation. Altering the colour and pixel position would have great use for our COMP120 assignment which required image manipulation.

I struggled with this task, and with the coding process. I immediately attempted to overcome my difficulty by approaching my lecturer. I spent time after class asking questions and practising further with this process and after an hour I created a functional program.

After being assigned our pair programming groups, we have decided to compelte the tasks of creating an interactive mood board and power-ups. Both of these tasks involve sci-fi genre so interest our group.

##Week 5 - Picture Techniques & Essay Peer Reviews

//colour ranges
//struggled with distances
//attempt to dedicate an hour to practise in class demonstration

To complete our COMP120 assignment, we learnt more about picture techniques including changing colours based on certain colour ranges, found colour distances between two colours and also restricted these changes to certain pixels. I found this task difficult, confusing my getColor function assuming that getColor(black) was required instead of actually black.getColor().

I tasked the evening to practising this technique and was able to create code which was able to change certain colours and manipulate the colour distances. To practise, I attempt to dedicate an hour in the evening after lecture to repeat in class demonstration.

I also learned that when creating a function that requires the same colour more than once, and reuse code, the method could include the colour as a variable. E.g. def removeRedEye(color1,color2): where color1.getColor() is used instead.

When learning the principle of Agile, including user stories, scrum & sprints; the process of backlog and assigning tasks are useful when maintaining achievable pace. Realistic pace is the goal not doubling work. Brook's Law gives reason to Agile, more people joining a group half way through a project reduces pace.

For me, the relevant issue of time management meant this technique would improve this. As a next step, I should maintain use of achievable user stories and create a maintainable pace.

Later in the week, we used peer review to evaluate our essays. It was useful to see how other students had approached their essay, but allowed me to review others reviews using the marking criteria. This meant that I could use the feedback that other people gave me but also was not able to critically review my own work using the same marking criteria.

##Week R - Sprint & Worksheet 2

The creative coding task was difficult and I required a lot of research and additional material to make me feel confident to even start writing code. There were numerous occasations where I made a typo which was later corrected, but having caused a great amount of time wasted.

While trying to keep the objective in mind, it was interesting to compare with what my peers had created and attempted to achieve and display using code and comments. Because my project was different to those that I saw, it made my task completely different so that I still had to be creative but gave me the ideas I needed to layout my code.

Creating the worksheets was partly confusing, as the depth of a flowchart is debatable, and the content is rather vague. I attempt to create a concise yet description guide on the flow of my project. The same was done for the pseudo code.

In the next weeks tutor session, I shall idenify my struggles with this.

##Week 6

Having discussing this with Ed, I'm now more confident with my understand with the flow chart and it's pseudo code.

We were given an introduction to databases, OOP and additional guidance with our academic writing.

When discussing the ability to use classes, it provided a way to improve my sophistication of my tinkering projects. I plan on using classes and referencing to make my code cleaner and easier to manipulate.

With databases, it was my first enconunter with the terminology so there was a lot to learn. I should ask for futher guidance for terms I am still unsure of. The referencing of keys is similar to that of classes but I am still unsure of the difference between a primary and foreign key.

The SQL language is a difficult new language for me to understand, so I require additional study time to make sure I am confident in this language.

I have also been assigned a new essay task so I should start researching and drafting my essay topic of PCG.

##Week 7

The additional information on referencing and how python uses classes was helpful in using them in my coding task. The use of access control was also useful in understand when and where a class can be referenced. For my coding taskings, I should practise this method of using classes.

##Week 8

We learned about memory allocation, usage and how to rewrite or expand memory space. We also looked at the use of lists and tuples, however it seemed confusing how pythons approach was different to other coding languages. The use of dictionaries was a useful method to consider when thinking about databases and creating referencing.

I have spent additional research time on this topic and should attempt to include this into my database project.

##Week 9

The use of modules provided more opportunity for making my tinkering code more sophisticated as it allowed for calling a module from a different program, similar to how kivy calls other files into the code.

The ability to predict an error is useful in giving guidance to the user should an error occur.

We also examined the execution time of a program and how this scales with the project size. I am still unsure of the use of Big O and should ask for further guidance on this as I struggled during the socrative quiz.

Having studied A level maths, I understood the common complexity classes graphs.

##Week 10

Today we used peer review to give guidance to the final draft of our essays. I found this a useful task as I should see how other students approach to the same or different topic essay.

I should be able to finalise my essay using my review as guidance. As a reflection of my previous essay submission, I submitted my work to my lecturer for final evaluation to be confident in my referencing format. This provided an insightful addition to my approach and improve some of the formatting issues that had been missed.

##Week x1

I am struggling to use classes to improve the sophistication of my work. To make this work, I should seek guidance from lecturers and the internet. I am continuing to work through the Introduction to Python book to improve my understanding of Jython for my tinkering project.

I have consulted a variety of varying tutorials as to cleaning up code and improved sophistation, however I should attempt to consider my main objective as my focus.

##Week x2

While working on my game app, I found a useful tutorial which uses flappy bird as an example. It's use of false gravity, menu screen, scoring system and object collision are things I need for my platformer game.

This has caused an interruption to my tinkering project as I have struggled with management of projects. It is crucial that I maintain pace on my graphics and audio project while still working on my app and database project.

##Week x3

The alterations to the gravity system are difficult to manage. I haven't been able to find a way to make the player stop their downward movements while allowing them to increase the velocity upwards when the button is pressed. In order to over come this issue, I'll atttempt to continue my research into other approaches to this gravity system while testing my code.

If the gravity doesn't work by my next support session, I should identify this issue to my lecturer.

##Week x4

My audio project is starting to produce some effects which could be used in my game theme tune. I'm confused on how to implement the parsing of notes however with further investigation I should be able to include this in my source code.

I'll attempt to reference to the relevant reading material provide and create a pull request for my lecture to give guidance on how to tackle my difficulties.

##Week 11

For my tinkering graphics project, the obstacle of speed is reducing the engagement of the animations I am attempting to include. Perhaps if I did this task again, I would have used another program to increase speed.

With our peer reviews and lecturer feedback, I should be able to make the final edits to my tinkering projects. While I have struggled with the start of the course and time managment, I think that this project has improved my ability to review my peers work but also recognising mistakes in my own work.

##Week 12

#Weakness

##Time managament

When working on projects, I struggle to manage my time proper. Attempting to balance my personal responsibilities with my work demands while maintaining time for myself to relax has been difficult to do. Finding set times to do work has improved my concentration during my work sessions and allowed for less guilty relaxation time.

For example, I preferred to work on some projects more than others as the content was more enjoyment material to learn and so I was more confident in my research and knowledge. This meant that some projects were worked on less than others and so my knowledge didn't improve and my confidence was low.

##Ability to critic others work

It is more difficult to critic others work than your own as I'm not comfortable in marking people low or finding fault. It was a difficult task to do at points as I felt I didn't fully comprehend my own work, besides someone else. This made me feel inadeqite to mark someone elses work.

However, when I started to mark more peoples work, I found similaries of problems that I had found and was able to provide solutions and improvements. I even was able to improve my own work having marking others work and discovering a new approach to a problem of layout.

##Asking questions

This has been a constant issue throughout the course. I am not confident enough to highlight my struggles and am embarrased by code. I have become frustrated at times as hours have been poured into projects for it to be all deleted and nothing to show for my time and effort.

Perhaps if I had been able to ask more questions then I wouldn't have spent so many hours over simple issues.

##Code sophistication

This is another issue that I have struggled to improve as this appears to be an improve that can be made when the project is completed and only needs polishing. This perhaps could have improved the readability in my code and the layout.

In the final weeks for my projects I'll attempt to improve my code sophistication to improve my confidence when presenting my work.
